## Description:
---------------

Quest mod for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BG:EE), Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET):

(This version may work with BG1 with TotSC and Tutu but it is untested, feedback are welcome...)

Dark Horizons is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate with Tales of the Sword Coast. This mod will have one major quest. An organization has been contracted to seek you out and eliminate you by whatever means necessary. Find out who they are before they take you out of play.
There will be multiple minor quests as well a few "Fed Ex" quests.
There are many new custom items added to this mod as well as new areas to explore. Remember Dark Horizons requires the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack (Originally included in Enhanced Edition). 


## Install:
-----------

Extract archive contents into your game directory

    Double click setup-DarkHorizons.exe and follow the instructions.

Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility for conflicts. We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official patches. If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please our forums. 

**EET** : Install this mod **in your BGEE game BEFORE** EET!

**BGT** : Install this mod **in your BG2 game AFTER** BGT!

## Compatibility:
------------------

Dark Horizons should be compatible with most Weidu mods, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. This version works with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy.

## FAQS:
--------

Q: What do I need to use this MOD?
A: Dark Horizons requires Baldur's Gate with Tales of the Sword Coast and the latest Bioware/Interplay patches. If you have the 3 CD "Original Saga" you do not need the latest patch since that comes with the latest patch already. We also strongly encourage the installation of the Baldurdash Fixpack. This mod will also work with the Tutu and BGT variations of the game.

Q: Is this mod quest or NPC mod?
A: Originally it was both but at the first release its just a quest & encounters mod. The three new NPCs will be brought in at a later version of this mod.

Q: So there are a lot of new encounters and quests?
A: There are many encounters in Dark Horizons. They range from cut throat assassins to crazy druids. But not all encounters are hostile, some of them may be beneficial to you if you help them out. There are minor quests and the main quest that will lead you to those who are responsible for sending these assassins after you.

Q: Rumor has it this mod now incorporates the BG1 Adventures and Forge mods. True?
A: True. The original authors were kind enough to add this into Dark Horizons. 


## Credits:
-----------

Many people are to be thanked for their support and contribution to this mod.

First and foremost, we'd like to thank Bioware and Black Isle for supplying us with such an enjoyble PC game. We would also like to thank the Infinity Engine community as a whole for their ongoing dedication and support of the Baldur's Gate series.

Personal thank you to KenTeamBG and all of those old school tool creators, custom item creators and those who provided their knowledge at the old and only *real* TeamBG which started off at the old BGRealms site. Without Ken and his dedication to this community in the early days, mods such as this would not be possible.

    Team Dark Raven and Magnus for supplying their mods; BG1 Adventure Pack and CoM Forge.
    Dark Raven for the Gullykin Quest.
    Scud for compatibility issues with BGT/BWP.
    10th for finding some issues.
    White Agnus for making a version for BGT (Baldur's Gate Trilogy), Tutu and taking the time to traify the files for future translations.
    Big thanks to the old school custom item creators.
    Lord Delekhan was the master at item creating.
    GMAN another great item creator.
    Doufas, Kylun, Roach, Trix, Suryiel, Graf Hohfels and many more of the old school "cutomizers".
    CúChoinneach, Roach, Grog, WoRm for giving us Dark Side of the Sword Coast, which in turn inspired me to create Dark Horizons.

    Introduced two new NPCs, Thorin and Nikita.                                                                                                                    
    Nikita will leave Section after the leaders decide to kill you. She will join your party later if you want her.                                                
    You can now encounter Davenport after Chapter 3 instead of after Chapter 4.                                                                                    
    Removed the Usability text from the items since BG:EE will automatically add the text in.
