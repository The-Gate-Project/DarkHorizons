  </p>
<p><a name="faqs"><b>IV. FAQS</b>
  </a></p>
<p><a name="faqs">Q: What do I need to use this MOD?<br>
A: Dark Horizons requires Baldur's Gate with Tales of the Sword Coast
and the latest Bioware/Interplay patches. If you have the 3 CD
"Original Saga" you do not need the latest patch since that comes with
the latest patch already. We also strongly encourage the installation
of the Baldurdash Fixpack. This mod will also work with the Tutu and
BGT variations of the game. </a></p>
<p><a name="faqs">Q: Is this mod quest or NPC mod?<br>
A: Originally it was both but at the first release its just a quest
&amp; encounters mod. The three new NPCs will be brought in at a later
version of this mod. </a></p>
<p><a name="faqs">Q: So there are a lot of new encounters and quests?<br>
A: There are many encounters in Dark Horizons. They range from cut
throat assassins to crazy druids. But not all encounters are hostile,
some of them may be beneficial to you if you help them out. There are
minor quests and the main quest that will lead you to those who are
responsible for sending these assassins after you. </a></p>
<p><a name="faqs">Q: Rumor has it this mod now incorporates the BG1 Adventures and Forge mods. True?<br>

  A: True. The original authors were kind enough to add this into Dark Horizons.
  </a></p>
<p><a name="faqs"><s>Q: What is this Harder Enemies component?<br>

  A: This gives a few selected enemies in the game a boost in stats and/or some of the new items this mod has.</s>

  <b>V. <a name="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a name="general">  </a>
  </p>
<p>Dark Horizons is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate with Tales of
the Sword Coast. This mod will have one major quest. An organization
has been contracted to seek you out and eliminate you by whatever means
necessary. Find out who they are before they take you out of play. <br>

There will be multiple minor quests as well a few "Fed Ex" quests.
   <br>

There are many new custom items added to this mod as well as new areas to explore. &nbsp;Remember Dark Horizons requires
    the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack.
