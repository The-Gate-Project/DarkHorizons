The obsidian head of this mace is that of a pretty, young girl. When wielded in combat the pretty face twists into a leering visage with a wide fanged maw.
This mace is not a weapon of the Material Plane, it was forged in the Abyss. It is a sentient weapon and it communicates through telepathy trying to influence wielder and steer him onto the path of chaos and destruction. The Maiden is always hungry for blood tries to make its wielder help her satisfy that hunger.
A weak willed wielder will fall under the control of the Screaming Maiden. When the mace wounds a victim it drinks deep and uses some of the blood to heal its wielder.

Not a small portion of his fame as an archer without peer is due to the powers of his wondrous bow. After his tragic death, O'Locksley's bow was passed on to his nephew; Jaen of Southerton Jaen used the bow for two decades to continue to fight injustice and evil in the country. He entrusted it to an elven friend before setting out on a secret mission from which he never returned. The elf gave the bow to his queen, and it has since been passed down among royalty of the elven court. Several times it has been lost, but it has always been recovered due to the diligence of the elve's searches. It was last used in a raid on the Goblin King's Lair. Both Treestalker and the bow were lost after the raid, and the elves are continually searching for both.

Thee bow is of exceptional quality, it is made of ancient yew that some say came from thee the great World Tree, Yaggissdril. The magic bow is of such that it never needs to be restrung or tightened, even after getting wet. The draw of the bow is feather light so extreme accuracy and speed is easily obtained.

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry...or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself- but whom ever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is...wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him...or any other humanoid.

This blade has traveled far since its forging on the shores of the Shining Sea, though documentation of its passage is sketchy because of the mundane nature of the item. Such weapons are considered commonplace among the rich elite of the far south, and are of little consequence to historians of the area. This attitude is incomprehensible to a citizen of the Sword Coast, where people routinely die for items of equal or lesser enchantment. This particular blade may have belonged to a wealthy Vizar, or perhaps his attendant.

In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest.  A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared to try and cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it.  With the help of powerful forest animals Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood.  The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest.  Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily . . . nay, VERY happily ever after!'

His battle cry was favored by the gods, and was echoed across the lands as a symbol of devoted friendship and loyalty. Thus, the magical axe was used to uphold these virtues, to be used against those who lacked honor and courage.
